## Hello there

This Node server is built using Expressjs and connects to postgres via sequelize which is a ORM for Nodejs.

This is a revamp version of my preliminary node server where i used pure SQL queries. It can be found [here](https://github.com/hermanwongkm/PreFrontalCortex).

The Node server is currently hosted on AWS elastic beanstalk together with AWS RDS for the database, while the [frontend component](https://github.com/hermanwongkm/OccipitalLobe) is hosted on AWS S3.
